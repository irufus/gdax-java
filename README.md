# New Path

gdax-java was intended to become a java GUI app.  The intent of this fork is to turn it into a server side service that can feed a MongoDB database and can track market state information (ie. current bids, ask, orders).

# Progress

- Completed
    - [x] Remove joda time in favor of Java 8's java.time api.
    - [x] Currently their are two json parsers remove one.
    - [x] Fix logging.
    - [x] Look at removing spring framework in place of a configuration and URL api or custom classes.
    - [x] Convert all instance variables and static variables to configs.
    - [x] Add JAR shading to build
    - [x] Modify License to show changes

- Currently
    - Turn instance config into a json file readable config from arg.
    - Create test instances for non-network functions.
    - Create handler for websockets as it currently throws all data away.
    - Look for and fix/clean code.
    - Add additional logging

- Next Steps
    - Add MongoDB Client and operations.
    - Add Mocking framework and test for testing network functions.
    - Add state system.
    - Add Travis script
    - Verify that IO operations are Asynchronous or threaded.
	- Add FIX for bidding.

# gdax-java

Java based wrapper for the [GDAX API](https://docs.gdax.com/#introduction) that follows the development style similar to [coinbase-java](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-java)

# Notes:

> GDAX primary data sources and servers run in the Amazon US East data center. To minimize latency for API access, we recommend making requests from servers located near the US East data center.
> Some of the methods do not yet have tests and so may not work as expected until a later date. Please raise an issue in github if you want something in particular as a priority.

# Functions supported:
- [x] Authentication (GET, POST, DELETE supported)
- [x] Get Account
- [x] Get Accounts
- [x] Get Account History
- [x] Get Holds
- [x] Place a new Order (limit order)
- [x] Get an Order
- [x] Cancel an Order
- [x] List all open Orders
- [x] Get Market Data
- [x] List fills
- [x] List Products
- [x] HTTP Error code support
- [x] List of Currencies - from Accounts
- [x] Withdrawals - from coinbase accounts / payment methods / crypto account address
- [x] Deposits - from coinbase accounts / payment methods
- [x] Transfers - from coinbase accounts
- [x] Payment methods - coinbase / payment methods
- [x] Reports
- [x] Pagination support for all calls that support it.
- [x] Pagination support for all calls that support it.
- [x] Sandbox support - *sandbox support was dropped by gdax so this is now redundant*

# Usage
--------

To build and run the application you can use the gradle script - this requires no installation as the "gradle wrapper" is included as part of the source code. All you need to do is:

1. supply your api keys in `gdax-java/src/main/resources/application.yml`
1. open a command line terminal
1. navigate to the root directory of this project (where `build.gradle` sits) 
1. execute `./gradlew bootRun` (Mac/unix). For equivalent Windows commands just remove the `./` from the commands, there's a gradlew.bat included as well.

This won't actually do much on its own but I did implement a slightly experimental (buggy) GUI which you can switch on and try by changing the setting gui.enabled in the application.yml above to `true`. You should then see a streamed list of updates displayed in a rather rubbish GUI I was attempting to build out. This is a work in progress so please don't assume its a finished product - its just for demoing that this works.

1. tests can also be run with  `./gradlew test` - simple

For a lib:

1. If you'd rather work purely in java then you can build an executable jar file `./gradlew jar` and you should be able to find the jar in the build directory.

# Examples

To make use of this library you only need a reference to the service that you want.

At present the classes match the interface specified in the coinbase/gdax api here: https://docs.gdax.com/#api

#Notes:

> GDAX primary data sources and servers run in the Amazon US East data center. To minimize latency for API access, we recommend making requests from servers located near the US East data center.

> Some of the methods do not yet have tests and so may not work as expected until a later date. Please raise an issue in github if you want something in particular as a priority. I'll be looking to fully flesh this out if possible over the coming months.

#Examples
--------

To make use of this library you only need a reference to the service that you want.

At present the classes match the interface specified in the coinbase/gdax api here: https://docs.gdax.com/#api

e.g. 
`public OrderService orderService(){
    new OrderService();
}`

This works better if you declare the above method as a google guice/spring bean and then wire it in using dependency injection.

Then in your method you can carry out any of the public api operations such as `orderService().createOrder(NewSingleOrder order);` - this creates a limit order. Currently this is only the basic order.

# API
--------

The Api for this application/library is as follows:
(Note: this section is likely to change but is provided on the basis it will work well for example usage)

- `AccountService.getAccounts()` - returns a List Accounts
- `AccountService.getAccountHistory(String accountId)` - returns the history for a given account as a List
- `AccountService.getHolds(String accountId)` - returns a List of all held funds for a given account.
- `DepositService.depositViaPaymentMethod(BigDecimal amount, String currency, String paymentMethodId)` - makes a deposit from a stored payment method into your GDAX account
- `DepositService.coinbaseDeposit(BigDecimal amount, String currency, String coinbaseAccountId)` - makes a deposit from a coinbase account into your GDAX account
- `MarketDataService.getMarketDataOrderBook(String productId, String level)` - a call to ProductService.getProducts() will return the order book for a given product. You can then use the WebsocketFeed api to keep your orderbook up to date. This is implemented in this codebase. Level can be 1 (top bid/ask only), 2 (top 50 bids/asks only), 3 (entire order book - takes a while to pull the data.)
- `OrderService.getOpenOrders(String accountId)` - returns a List of Orders for any outstanding orders
- `OrderService.cancelOrder(String orderId)` - cancels a given order
- `OrderService.createOrder(NewOrderSingle aSingleOrder)` - construct an order and send it to this method to place an order for a given product on the exchange.
- `PaymentService.getCoinbaseAccounts()` - gets the coinbase accounts for the logged in user
- `PaymentService.getPaymentTypes()` - gets the payment types available for the logged in user
- `ProductService.getProducts()` - returns a List of Products available from the exchange - BTC-USD, BTC-EUR, BTC-GBP, etc.
- `ReportService.createReport(String product, String startDate, String endDate)` - not certain about this one as I've not tried it but presumably generates a report of a given product's trade history for the dates supplied


# WebsocketFeed API 
---------------------

At present the WebsocketFeed is implemented and does work (as in it will receive the messages from the exchange and route them according to the message type) but it requires you to pass a `new Subscribe(productIds)` message to it and to implement an OrderBook class as I've partly done under the `gui` package (as I was attempting to build a desktop gui since the web one has consistently had problems).
 
Presently this is not an interface as this is a work in progress, however feel free to fork this repo, make the change and send me a pull request back and I'll gladly merge in the change. 
 

# Updates
--------
- converted to using Gradle
- converted to using SpringBoot for DI and request building
- updated all libraries used - removed some unnecessary libraries
- refactored the code to remove error handling from every method (rightly/wrongly) - its easier to maintain and extend now as a result
- more modular code that matches the service api - favour composition over inheritance
- removed a lot of boilerplate code
- logging added - Logging will output an equivalent curl command now for each get/post/delete request so that when debugging you can copy the curl request and execute it on the command line.
- service tests added for sanity - no unit tests against the data objects
- better configuration options using `application.yml` for your live environment and `application-test.yml` for your sandbox environment.
- banner displayed (specific to each environment) :)
- generally more structure.
- added pagination to all the relevant calls (some not supported since it seems pointless due to the limited offering from gdax - e.g. products)
- GDAX is updating its API without updating documentation - I've fixed an issue with market data because of this.
- WebsocketFeed added
- OrderBook GUI component added - enable in the `application.yml` by setting enabled to `true`

# TODO
-------
- add pagination versions of all endpoints, or offer a way to append to the endpoint urls.
