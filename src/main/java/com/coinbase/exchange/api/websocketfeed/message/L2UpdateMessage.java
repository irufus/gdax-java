 * Subsequent updates will have the type l2update.
 * The changes property of l2updates is an array with [side, price, size] tuples.
 * The time property of l2update is the time of the event as recorded by our trading engine. Please note that size is the updated size at that price level, not a delta. A size of "0" indicates the price level can be removed.
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "type": "l2update",
 *   "product_id": "BTC-GBP",
 *   "changes": [
 *     [
 *       "buy",
