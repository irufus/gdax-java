/**
 * An order has changed. This is the result of self-trade prevention
 * adjusting the order size or available funds. Orders can only
 * decrease in size or funds. change messages are sent anytime an
 * order changes in size; this includes resting orders (open) as
 * well as received but not yet open. change messages are also
 * sent when a new market order goes through self trade prevention
 * and the funds for the market order have changed.

 * change messages for received but not yet open orders can be
 * ignored when building a real-time order book. The side field
 * of a change message and price can be used as indicators for whether
 * the change message is relevant if building from a level 2 book.
 *
 * Any change message where the price is null indicates that the change
 * message is for a market order. Change messages for limit orders will
 * always have a price specified.
